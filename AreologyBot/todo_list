TODO LIST:
________________________________________________________________________________

Consider adding TrainQueen to its own file, but also maybe not.

better optimize drone and overlord scouting patterns (redo retreat_drone_scout, doesn't actually select the scouting drone atm / same with overlord scout)

add early game defense measures from information gathered from scouting

implement Queen creep spread (possibly use legacy code)

Add focus fire and stutter step micro

Add upgrades

Fix drone army building production algorithms past roach push

Make a new variable where i store scouting information

fix spine crawler placement location to natural base or closest to enemy main in BuildOrder.py

NOTES:

use len() instead of .amount from now on (apparently it's faster)
