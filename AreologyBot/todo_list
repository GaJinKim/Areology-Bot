TODO LIST:
________________________________________________________________________________

Consider adding TrainQueen to its own file, but also maybe not.

better optimize drone and overlord scouting patterns (redo retreat_drone_scout, doesn't actually select the scouting drone atm / same with overlord scout)

add early game defense measures from information gathered from scouting

implement Queen creep spread (possibly use legacy code)

Add focus fire and stutter step micro
